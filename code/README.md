# Code for optimisation

The folders include the code for end-to-end implementation of the portfolio optimisation using rival scenario trees. The code is separated into 3 parts:

- Python code is the wrapper code to combine all the separate libraries written in C++, CPLEX and Python.
- C++ code is used to run the scenario tree simulation.
- CPLEX code is used for portfolio optimisation.

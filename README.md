## Robust Portfolio Optimisation under Uncertainty with Rival Scenario Trees

We consider a robust multi-stage portfolio framework for optimising conditional value at risk (CVaR). The approach extends the multi-period CVaR optimisation framework to worst-case design with multiple rival return and risk scenarios. The stages are modelled using a discrete set of rival scenario trees and the robustness is ensured by considering the worst-case CVaR, which leads to a discrete minimax programme. The minimax set-up gives a portfolio that is optimal for the worst-case scenario and the performance is guaranteed to improve if the worst-case does not materialise. The project implements and test the basic model and its variants, with particular emphasis on the sensitivity of the optimal portfolio to the scenario tree sampling specifications. Backtesting results based on historical financial data are also presented.

The project was supervised by Prof. Berc Rustem and Dr. Ruth Misener from the Imperial Department of Computing.

# Repository Structure

The repository is largely divided into 3 sections:
1. **code** - consist of scripts to run the simulation.
1. **data** - underlying test data for backtesting.
1. **results** - output files from the scripts.

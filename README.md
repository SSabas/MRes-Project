## Robust Portfolio Optimisation under Uncertainty with Rival Scenario Trees

We consider a robust multi-stage portfolio framework for optimising conditional value at risk (CVaR). During the first-stage, robustness is ensured by considering an ellipsoid uncertainty set for the corresponding expected returns. Subsequent stages are modelled using a robust framework with a (discrete) set of rival scenario trees. The first-stage essentially leads to a semi-infinite optimisation problem that can be simplified using duality to a second-order cone program. The discrete set of rival scenario trees in subsequent stages lead to discrete minimax. 
For large-scale scenario trees, Benders decomposition is needed. Past backtests with rival scenario trees have consistently yielded favourable results. The project will implement and test the basic model and subsequently consider its variants.
